Hi, I'm Dilan Rodríguez Triana and I'm the Game Designer and **Social Media Manager** at Serac Studio. In my case, I am in charge of balancing the mechanics within the video games we make and also maintaining activity on the Twitter and YouTube accounts. Talking a bit about myself, I played my first video game at the age of 3 (PSOne's Tomb Raider) and since then it has become my passion. During these years, I have played various video games, and the one that has led me to want to dedicate myself to the video game sector has been Bloodborne, from From Software. I've made Hell’s Trial and Crystal Wars. You can contact me on *dilanSeracStudio@gmail.com*.

Born in Almería by September '99 and living there until college, although I don't like it so much. Moved to Madrid to study a video games' degree in the glorious URJC, where I met the partners that form now Serac Studio. Once I was in Japan and I talked too much about it. Project manager and narrative designer. Also, a helper in any task that require it, but the coding ones. Along with my mates Alejandro, Germán and Dilan, we've joined two game jams having Hell's Trial and Untitled Board Game as results. In addition, we have worked on Crystal Wars in this company. My heart tells me Nintendo, but my mind tells me PC Master Race. Big fan of Fire Emblem saga, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Hotline Miami, Pokémon Platinum and Portal. You can contact me via Twitter to *@Wonick97* or sending an email to *pabloSeracStudio@gmail.com*.

> Always place your becoming above your current being.

Hi! My name is Germán, and I was born in 1999 in Cantabria, northern Spain. From an early age I have been interested in videogames, starting back in 2004 with Pokémon Emerald and, later on, with others such as Age of Empires and World of Warcraft, along my childhood friends. After finishing highschool, I moved to Madrid to pursue my dreams of becoming a videogame developer. A few months ago, I founded Serac Studio with some colleagues I met while studying at the URJC. There, I work as a back-end developer for all our projects. Since then, we have launched a fast-paced card game called Crystal Wars (which you can play on itch.io!) and are currently in the making of a fresh new 3D web-based game. You can contact me at germanSeracStudio@gmail.com for any business inquiry.
